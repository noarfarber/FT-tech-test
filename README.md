# FT tech test

## The Task

Build a server-rendered site that displays headlines from The Financial Times. 
You may use our Developer APIs to achieve this. 
Additionally, provide a search box for users to search for headlines containing specific words (i.e. searching for "brexit" should return a list of brexit-related headlines).

Optionally, the project could:

● Be responsive
● Be accessible
● Have pagination
● Not be reliant on client-side frameworks (i.e. Angular, React) or libraries like jQuery
● Built using Javascript and node.js
● Uses Origami Components
● Progressively enhanced
● Deployed on Heroku
● Have a similar look and feel as ft.com
● Perform well over 3G networks
Work offline

Please submit both links to your functioning app and source repo.

repo) along with documentation, testing, or any other aspects you consider relevant.
