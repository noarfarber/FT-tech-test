## Some Notes

Thank you for taking the time to review my task.
I appreciate the opportunity and have enjoyed working on it.

From the optional list, I chose to:
* Create a project that is not reliant on client-side frameworks
* Give it a similar look as ft.com

## The Task

Build a server-rendered site that displays headlines from The Financial Times. 
You may use our Developer APIs to achieve this.

Additionally, provide a search box for users to search for headlines containing specific words (i.e. searching for "brexit" should return a list of brexit-related headlines).

Optionally, the project could:

- Be responsive
- Be accessible
- Have pagination
- Not be reliant on client-side frameworks (i.e. Angular, React) or libraries like jQuery
- Built using Javascript and node.js
- Uses Origami Components
- Progressively enhanced
- Deployed on Heroku
- Have a similar look and feel as ft.com
- Perform well over 3G networks
- Work offline


## Getting Started

* To run this project you will need to set up an api key from the FT and add it to your .env file

```
$ git clone https://github.com/noarfarber/FT-tech-test.git
$ cd FT-tech-test
$ npm install
$ nodemon start
```
Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.
